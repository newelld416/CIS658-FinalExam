# Daniel Newell Test Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Unit tests
The main objective of unit tests is to detect regressions and to help you design software components. A suite of good unit tests can be immensely valuable for your project and makes it easier to refactor and expand your code. But keep in mind that a suite of bad unit tests can also be immensely painful, and hurt your development by inhibiting your ability to refactor or alter your code in any way.
